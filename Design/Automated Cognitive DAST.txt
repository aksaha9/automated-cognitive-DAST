Automated Cognitive DASTThe ProblemTraditional DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) is rigid. Automated scanners lack context—they don't know how our organization tests, which logic flows are critical, or how to navigate complex authentication. Conversely, manual PenTesting is thorough but unscalable. We need a solution that bridges this gap.The SolutionAutomated Cognitive DAST is an AI-driven security agent that wraps the industry-standard ZAP Proxy in the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It orchestrates security scans using natural language, enriched by our organization's specific testing methodologies (RAG), and analyzes results for genuine exploitability.Key Innovations1. MCP-Native Architecture: By wrapping ZAP in an MCP Server, we allow any MCP-compliant client (Gemini CLI, Claude Code) to interact with the scanner directly. The LLM acts as the "driver," making real-time decisions on scan depth and strategy.2. Organizational Alignment (RAG): Before scanning, our agent queries a vector database containing the organizations’s "VA Team Playbooks." It learns that "Company123 requires JWT manipulation tests on all Finance APIs," and dynamically instructs ZAP to perform these specific attacks.3. Hybrid AI Intelligence:o Orchestrator (Cloud LLM): Handles complex logic, report generation, and exploitability reasoning.o Privacy Layer (Ollama): Processes sensitive header data or performs offline logic checks to ensure PII doesn't leak to public models.4. Universal Authentication Config: A standardized JSON configuration allows our agent to script ZAP’s authentication (OAuth2, scripting-based auth) automatically, solving the #1 pain point in automated DAST: losing the session.Value PropositionWe are moving from "Static Scanning" to "Agentic Security Testing." Automated Cognitive DAST doesn't just run a script; it reads our policy, understands the target, executes the scan, and tells us what actually matters.
